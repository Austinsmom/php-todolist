Description
-----------

This is a simple PHP script that can scan a collection of files for comment tags
that contain tasks, such as "TODO:" or "KLUDGE:". There are two parts: the
ToDoParser class, which does most of the grunt work, and the frontend which can
be used from the command line.


Installation
------------




Usage
-----

Todo List searches for the following tags at the start of comments:

TASK:, KLUDGE:, HACK:, NOTE:, TEMP:

For example, the following comment would generate a Todo entry in the Hack
category:

; HACK: This is a hack.
someBlitzCodeHere()

Tasks can be filtered using the drop-down menu, and can be sorted by their line
number, filename, type and description.
