Version      : 1.0
Release Date : 20th March, 2001
Licence      : BSD [ http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php ]


Description
-----------

This is a simple PHP script that can scan a collection of files for comment tags
that contain tasks, such as "TODO:" or "KLUDGE:". There are two parts: the
ToDoParser class, which does most of the grunt work, and the frontend which is
used from the command line. 

The get-todo and get-todo.bat scripts make things little cleaner to use but 
aren't essential.


Installation
------------

The command line client requires the following PEAR packages:
    * Console_Color
    * Console_CommandLine

The parser supports Console_Color but does not require it.


Usage
-----

Usage:
  todo.php [options] <files...>

Options:
  -v, --verbose               Turn on verbose output (such as stats)

  -f, --format                Turn on colour formatting
  -r, --recurse               Recurse directories when scanning
  -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
  --version                   show the program version and exit

Arguments:
  files  list of files or directories to scan
